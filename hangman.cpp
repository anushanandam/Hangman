/*
 We are making a Hangman game in C++. In the game, there will be 2 players. Player 1 will be
 typing in a word for the other player to guess. After Player 1 types the word, the number of
 characters in the word would be visible to Player 2. The objective of the game is for Player 2
 to guess Player 1's word. If player 2 guesses wrong, a graphic of the Hangman will appear. If
 the complete graphic of the Hangman appears, then Player 2 has lost. Otherwise, if player 2
 guessed the word, it would be their turn to challenge player 1. This game is in a continuous
 loop until the players decide to quit. In addition to this, a 1 player mode has been added
 so that player 1 can play against the computer. We will implement a truth table to check
 player 2â€™s answer.
